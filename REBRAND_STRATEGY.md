# Echeo Rebrand Strategy

## 🎯 The Decision: YES to Echeo

**Why Echeo Wins:**
1. ✅ **Owned Brand Asset** - You own .io and .ai (massive value)
2. ✅ **Unique & Memorable** - Not a generic word like "Payload"
3. ✅ **Scalable** - Works for CLI, platform, network
4. ✅ **Meaningful** - "To Resonate" fits the product perfectly
5. ✅ **Professional** - Can grow into enterprise product

**The Sonar Aesthetic:**
- ✅ More sophisticated than "hacker terminal"
- ✅ Fits the "signal in noise" narrative
- ✅ Differentiates from competitors
- ✅ Professional yet powerful

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Binary Rename (Keep Everything Else)
**Goal:** Rename binary, update branding, keep all functionality

**Changes:**
- Rename `payload-cli` → `echeo` in Cargo.toml
- Update binary name to `echeo`
- Update all user-facing text
- Keep all code, features, functionality

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Risk:** Low (just renaming)

---

### Phase 2: Aesthetic Evolution (Gradual)
**Goal:** Add sonar visuals without breaking existing features

**Changes:**
- Add radar sweep animations (indicatif)
- Update color scheme (sonar green/cyan)
- Add "CONTACT DETECTED" messaging
- Keep all existing functionality

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Risk:** Low (additive changes)

---

### Phase 3: Full Rebrand (When Ready)
**Goal:** Complete sonar aesthetic, new terminology

**Changes:**
- "Ping" instead of "Scan"
- "Contact" instead of "Capability"
- "Signal" instead of "Match"
- "Echo" instead of "Deploy"
- Full sonar UI

**Time:** 1-2 days
**Risk:** Medium (more changes)

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Do This Now:**
1. ✅ Rename binary to `echeo`

**Do This Later:**

**Why:**
