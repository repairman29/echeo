# Echeo Rebrand - Decision & Strategy

## 🎯 My Honest Opinion

**Echeo is the RIGHT choice. Here's why:**

### ✅ Why Echeo Wins

1. **Owned Brand Asset** - You own .io and .ai (that's $50k+ value)
2. **Unique & Memorable** - Not generic like "Payload" or "Engine"
3. **Scalable** - Works for CLI, platform, network, enterprise
4. **Meaningful** - "To Resonate" fits the product perfectly
5. **Professional** - Can grow into enterprise product
6. **Differentiated** - No one else has this name

### ✅ Why Sonar Aesthetic Works

- **More Sophisticated** - Submarine commander vs. hacker
- **Fits Narrative** - "Signal in noise" is perfect
- **Professional** - Can sell to enterprises
- **Unique** - No one else does sonar UI
- **Powerful** - Still feels like a weapon, just smarter
